# ✈️ Airport Runway Taxi-Out Time Analysis Report

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes **airport taxi-out times** (the time from gate pushback to wheels-off), highlighting the operational, temporal, and weather-related factors influencing ground efficiency. The study identifies patterns across different dimensions and provides **strategic recommendations** for improving airport performance.  

---

## 📊 Executive Summary  
- Peak congestion occurs during **hours 3–4** with average taxi-out times of **42–43 minutes**  
- **Best efficiency** is observed between **hours 7–12** (19–30 minutes)  
- Weather (visibility, wind) shows **moderate impact**, with strong resilience in most cases  
- Runways and airlines show a **performance gap of 5–15 minutes**, revealing optimization opportunities

## 🔑 Key Findings  

### 1. Temporal Patterns  
- **Peak hours (3–4)** → Taxi-out times: **42–43 mins**  
- **Morning window (7–12)** → Efficient operations: **19–30 mins**  
- **Evenings (15–17)** → Moderate congestion: **28–29 mins**  
- **Weekdays vs weekends** → Minimal difference (**~37–38 mins**)  

### 2. Weather Impact  
- **Low visibility** → Highest taxi-out times (**44 mins**)  
- **Medium/high visibility** → Stable (**37–38 mins**)  
- **Wind speed** → Minimal effect (36–38 mins)  

### 3. Runway Performance  
- **Top performers**: Runways **04R, 22L (35–36 mins)**  
- **Congested runways**: **22R, 13L (39–40 mins)**  
- **Optimization gap**: ~5 minutes between best and worst  

### 4. Airline Analysis  
- **Most efficient**: AAL (American Airlines) → **30 mins**  
- **High performers**: SWA, UAL, AKJ → **31–33 mins**  
- **Lagging carriers**: THY, OFA → **42–45 mins**  
- **Gap**: ~15 minutes between airlines

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations  

### ✅ Immediate Actions  
- Enhance **ground control** during hours **3–4**  
- Review **low visibility procedures**  
- Optimize **runway assignment** (focus on 22R & 13L)  

### 🔧 Operational Improvements  
- Share **best practices** from efficient airlines  
- Improve **weather resilience** strategies  
- Assess **taxiway routing & infrastructure**  

### 📡 Monitoring & Future Work  
- Implement **real-time taxi-out monitoring**  
- Conduct **seasonal pattern analysis**  
- Use insights for **airport expansion planning**  

---

## 📌 Conclusion  
This study highlights that while **weather contributes moderately**, the **biggest optimization potential** lies in:  
- **Airline ground procedures**  
- **Runway management**  

Closing the **15-minute airline gap** and **5-minute runway gap** can significantly reduce delays, improve passenger satisfaction, and cut operational costs.
